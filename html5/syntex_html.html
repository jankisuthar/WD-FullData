HTML5 is the latest and most enhanced version of HTML. Technically, 
HTML is not a pogramming language, but rather a markup language.
HTML5 is the next major revision of the HTML standard superseding 
HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.0, and XHTML 1.1. HTML5 is a standard for structuring and presenting content on the 
World Wide Web.


HTML 5 does not have the same syntax rules as XHTML where we needed 
lower case tag names, 
quoting our attributes an attribute had to have a value and to close all empty elements.

But HTML5 is coming with lots of flexibility and would support the followings:

Uppercase tag names.  <b>  <B>
Quotes are optional for attributes. style="color:red" / type="text/css"  type='text/css'
Attribute values are optional.   type="tewxt/css"  === if not added that optional
Closing empty elements are optional.   <b></b> /  <b>


The DOCTYPE declaration for HTML5 is very simple:

<!DOCTYPE html>


HTML 5 authors can use simple syntax to specify Character Encoding as follows: 
 
HTML 4 supports UTF-8. HTML 5 supports both UTF-8 and UTF-16!  Unicode Transformation Format (UTF).

<meta charset="UTF-8">

<meta charset="utf-8" />


<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

Mobile-first styles are part of the core framework.
To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming, add the following <meta> tag inside the <head> element:

The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of 
the device (which will vary depending on the device).

The initial-scale=1 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded 
by the browser.







New HTML5 Elements
The most interesting new HTML5 elements are: 

New semantic / structuring elements like <header>, <footer>, <article>, and <section>.

New attributes of form elements like number, date, time, calendar, and range.

New graphic elements: <svg> and <canvas>.

New multimedia elements: <audio> and <video>.

You can also add new elements to an HTML page with a browser trick.
