Applications of Javascript Programming

Javascript is one of the most widely used programming languages 
(Front-end as well as Back-end). 
It has it's presence in almost every area of software development. 
I'm going to list few of them here:

This helps in adding and deleting any HTML tag very easily using javascript and modify 
your HTML to change its look and feel based on different devices and requirements.

and scalable network applications. This is an event based library which helps 
in developing very sophisticated server applications including Web Servers.
