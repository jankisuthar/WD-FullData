Bootstrap 4 is designed to be responsive to mobile devices. 
Mobile-first styles are part of the core framework.
To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming, add the following <meta> tag inside the <head> element:

The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of 
the device (which will vary depending on the device).

The initial-scale=1 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded 
by the browser.
